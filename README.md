Please search "Homepage" on the medium article to see screenshots of the site.

A website that makes complicated text more understandable for the selected audience. Simplify received the “Best Interaction Design” award at UC Berkeley’s Design Showcase of Summer 2019. First, the user selects the audience (children, general public, etc.) that they are writing for. Then, the user pastes or writes text into the site’s editor, and words would be highlighted with three colors depending on how understandable it is for the audience. When a user clicks on a highlighted word, suggestions are shown, and the user can easily replace their words as desired. Other functionalities include: filtering by priority, navigation to next highlighted word, and undo/redo replacements

Completed website design and functionality but uses predetermined text and highlights (out of scope given the time)
